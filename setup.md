# Setup

Installation is straight-forward: just add the gem to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "all_futures", "~> 1.0"
```

Since All Futures relies on Redis via the Kredis gem, please make sure that you have a Redis server running and that you have followed the [Kredis installation instructions](https://github.com/rails/kredis#installation).
